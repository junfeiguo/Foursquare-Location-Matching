# Foursquare-Location-Matching

Match point of interest data across datasets

The purpose of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict which Place entries represent the same point-of-interest. The problem to be addressed in this case study is to match Point-of-Interests using a simulated dataset from Foursquare which contains the Places and movement of customers of over one-and-a-half million Place entries to predict where new stores and businesses will benefit people the most.
